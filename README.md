# Neural-network-for-MNIST
The neural network will have 784 inputs, one 
hidden layer with n hidden units (where n is a parameter of your 
program), and 10 output units.  The hidden and output units use 
the sigmoid activation function.   The network fully connected 
â€”that is, every input unit connects to every hidden unit, and every 
hidden unit connects to every output unit.
